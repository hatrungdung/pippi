v2 beta 5

This version introduces libpippi, and starts the process of 
removing or refactoring libraries where needed so this thing 
can be a simple `pip install pippi` away again.

I'll note progress here as I go:

    - Replaced rand module implementation with libpippi's LPRand 
      module including new chaotic backends to drive all rand 
      interfaces with the logistic map or lorenz attractors instead 
      of a pseudo-random normal distribution which is the default.

    - Made a first pass at a new SoundBuffer which wraps libpippi 
      lpbuffer_t structs and implements the python buffer protocol.
      
    - Added support for multiplication to new SoundBuffers
    - Added support for concatination, addition and subtraction to new SoundBuffers
    - Added support for true and floor division to new SoundBuffers

v2 beta 4

This long-in-development beta introduced some new libraries, 
and some packaging issues I never managed to sort out, so all 
updates since this beta was started aren't available on pypi.

This version also brought with it a *ton* of new features, some 
speculative, many actively in use. I should have been keeping track 
of what I added when during the beta process, but I didn't!

v2 beta 3

The most recent version available on pypi. 
Lacking in most of the fun stuff.
