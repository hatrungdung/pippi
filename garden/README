An in-development collection of libpippi firmwares 
for the electro-smith daisy family.

All this is in a pretty early stage, I'm currently working 
on a couple personal projects with this stuff, so it's just an
undocumented dumping ground. Please take anything of use. 

To install and build the DaisyExamples repo which includes 
the libdaisy library and tooling needed for these firmware 
please run the `update.sh` script after installing the arm 
toolchain for your system:

    bash update.sh
