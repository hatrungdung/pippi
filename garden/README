An in-development collection of firmwares using libpippi:

    Electro-smith Petal
    Electro-smith Patch
    Electro-smith Field
    Electro-smith Pod

All this is in a pretty early stage, feel free to poke around 
but stuff is currently broke and unkempt as these things go.

To install and build the DaisyExamples repo which includes 
the libdaisy library and tooling needed for these firmware 
please run the `update.sh` script after installing the arm 
toolchain for your system:

    bash update.sh
